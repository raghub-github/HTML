            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These
                institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became
                increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning
                were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in Nagpur, among others.[citation needed] These
                institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study
                topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was
                among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan Empire</p>
